<p id="p1"><i>The Game Without Decency</i> is very similar to <i>Cards Against Humanity</i>. If you haven't 
played either, this game requires a minimum of 3 players- <b>18 and older</b>- where player 1 plucks a <i>Scenario</i> card and the remaining
players play their best response card. The response card, that's chosen by player 1 as their <u>favorite</u>, wins the
round. Each player gets a turn to play a Scenario card and pick their favorite response card.</p>

<p>Without a doubt, this game can get pretty raunchy...definitely not for the timid or easily offended! However, 
it can bring about lots of discussion and help you possibly discover new things about your friends..."</p>

<p>If you would like to purchase this game, feel free to visit <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"> Amazon </a>:
you will definitely find it there!</p>
